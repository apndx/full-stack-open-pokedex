# [Exercise 11.1](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/introduction_to_ci_cd#exercise-11-1)

In my hypothetical situation an application is coded with Java. In the CI setup linting is done using prettier plugin. The plugin can already be used during the development, so that there are no surprises when the code is linted when it is merged. The JUnit unit and integration tests in the project are run during the CI, using docker containers for needed services for the integration tests. The build is done using the Gradle Wrapper. When thinking about alternatives to setup the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub actions, there are for example Travis, or Drone that could be used. To decide, if this setup should be in a cloud-based information, we need to consider a few points. Do we have data that cannot be transferred outside Finland? If yes, maybe a self-hosted solution is what we need. If this is not an issue, and there is no desire or resources to build and maintain own infra for the solution, a cloud-base environment might be a good choice. Also the costs should be considered, and the costs using different cloud and self-hosted solutions should be compared. It is important to consider this carefully, as it might be hard and expensive to change the setup later.
